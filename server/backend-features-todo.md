# University Recommender Backend Enhancement Plan

## Current System Overview
- MongoDB database for university data storage
- Elasticsearch for search and recommendation functionality
- Express.js backend
- Current features include:
  - Basic university search and filtering
  - SAT score-based recommendations
  - Career and sports preference consideration
  - Comparison functionality

## Proposed Backend Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Filtering and Search API
- **Student-to-Faculty Ratio Filter**: Add endpoint for filtering universities by student-to-faculty ratio
- **Campus Safety Statistics**: Incorporate safety metrics into search parameters
- **Research Opportunities Filter**: Add filtering by research output or opportunities
- **Extended Location Search**: Allow searching by region, state clusters, or proximity to major cities

### 2. Personalized Recommendation Engine
- **Multi-criteria Recommendation API**: Create a more sophisticated recommendation endpoint that considers multiple factors
- **Weighted Preference System**: Allow users to assign weights to different criteria (location, cost, academics)
- **Recommendation Explanation API**: Add endpoint that explains why each university was recommended
- **Similar University Finder**: Endpoint to find universities similar to a specific one

### 3. Financial Aid and Cost Analysis
- **Financial Aid Calculator API**: Create endpoint that estimates financial aid based on student information
- **ROI Calculator**: Calculate potential return on investment based on cost, career path, and earning potential
- **Scholarship Matching Service**: Match students with available scholarships based on their profile

### 4. Campus Culture and Student Life
- **Campus Culture Matching**: Endpoint to match student preferences with campus culture data
- **Extracurricular Activity Mapping**: Match student interests with university clubs and activities
- **Diversity Statistics API**: Provide detailed diversity information

### 5. Academic Path Planning
- **Major/Career Path API**: Suggest universities based on intended major and career goals
- **Prerequisite Course Requirements**: Provide information on courses needed for specific programs
- **Graduation Rate by Demographics**: More detailed graduation statistics

### 6. Integration Features
- **Application Tracking API**: Help track application status and deadlines
- **Virtual Tour Data Integration**: Connect with virtual tour providers
- **Alumni Network Analysis**: Provide data on alumni networks and career outcomes

### 7. Data Enhancement Services
- **University Reviews API**: Integrate or collect student reviews
- **Historical Acceptance Rate Trends**: Show changes in acceptance rates over time
- **Employment Outcome Tracking**: Track employment rates and salaries by major

### 8. Technical Improvements
- **Caching Layer**: Implement Redis for frequently requested data
- **Batch Processing API**: Allow bulk operations for comparisons
- **User Preference Storage**: Store and retrieve user preferences for returning visitors
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- **Webhook Notifications**: Create notification system for application deadlines, new recommendations

## University 3D Map Visualization

### Core Functionality
- **3D Campus Map Integration**: Implement API endpoints that serve 3D map data of university campuses using MapBox or Google Maps
- **Building Information API**: Create endpoints to provide information about specific buildings on campus when selected
- **Interactive Campus Tour API**: Endpoints to support guided virtual tours through key campus locations

### Implementation Details
- **MapBox/Google Maps Integration**:
  - Create an endpoint that serves GeoJSON data for each university campus
  - Implement map styling configurations for consistent visual presentation
  - Store 3D building models or references to pre-existing models in the database

- **Map Data Management**:
  - Store map coordinates, building footprints, and landmark information in the database
  - Implement data validation for map-related information
  - Support point-of-interest tagging for important campus locations

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Implement tile-based loading for larger campuses
  - Add caching mechanisms for frequently accessed map data
  - Support different detail levels based on zoom factor

### Frontend Integration Support
- **Map Initialization API**: Endpoint to provide necessary configuration for frontend map initialization
- **Asset Delivery API**: Endpoints to efficiently deliver 3D models and textures
- **Navigation Data API**: Provide walking paths and routes between buildings

### Extended Features
- **Indoor Mapping API**: For selected buildings, provide indoor maps for key facilities
- **Seasonal Variations**: API to display campus in different seasons or times of day
- **Accessibility Routing**: Provide accessible routes for campus navigation

### Technical Requirements
- Store map-related data in MongoDB with proper indexing
- Use GeoJSON format for spatial data
- Implement efficient data transfer protocols for 3D assets
- Set up proper API authentication for access to premium map features



## Implementation Strategy
1. Prioritize features based on user impact and implementation complexity
2. Implement features in phases, starting with enhancements to existing endpoints
3. Create a consistent API structure for all new endpoints
4. Ensure proper error handling and validation for all new endpoints
5. Add comprehensive documentation for each new endpoint
6. Set up monitoring and logging for performance tracking

## Initial Focus Areas (Phase 1)
1. Enhanced Filtering and Search API
2. Multi-criteria Recommendation Engine
3. Financial Aid Calculator
